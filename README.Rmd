  make a file with bridge ID, year, fips codes, condition ratings, and a few other variables that interest you. Make your code reproducible. Make a plot.
```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
delaware<-read_csv("DE1919.txt",col_names = T)
head(delaware)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = delaware, mapping = aes(x = YEAR_BUILT_027, y = STRUCTURAL_EVAL_067)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/3) + ggtitle("Structural vs Year Built")
ggtitle("Structural vs Year Built")
smaller<-select(.data = delaware, STRUCTURE_NUMBER_008,YEAR_BUILT_027,COUNTY_CODE_003,STRUCTURAL_EVAL_067,SERVICE_LEVEL_005C)
smaller
